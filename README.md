# Mango Sorting System with Percentage Ripeness Classification
Mango Sorting System with Percentage Ripeness Classification: Advanced Diploma Project

## Introduction:
The Mango Sorting System with Percentage Ripeness Classification project aims to develop an automated sorting system capable of accurately assessing mango ripeness percentages. This system will utilize machine vision technology and advanced image processing algorithms to analyse mango attributes and classify ripeness levels.

## Project Objectives & Scope:
- **Specific:** Design and implement an automated sorting system capable of accurately assessing mango ripeness percentages.
- **Measurable:** Achieve an accuracy rate of at least 95% in ripeness classification based on empirical testing.
- **Achievable:** Utilize machine vision technology and image processing algorithms along with electronic components (NIR, etc) to analyse mango attributes and classify ripeness levels.
- **Relevant:** Address the pressing need for efficient fruit sorting systems to enhance product quality and consumer satisfaction in the fruit industry.
- **Time-bound:** Complete the development and testing of the sorting system within a timeframe of 7 months.

## Problem Statements: 
- Mango ripeness is a difficult concept for manual sorting methods in the fruit sector, which makes product quality and customer satisfaction inconsistent.
- Divergences in the degree of ripeness can lead to bad tasting sensations, shortened shelf lives, and substantial spoiling waste.
- The fruit business is in dire need of effective fruit sorting technologies to maximise productivity, reduce waste, and raise overall profitability.
